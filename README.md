### What is this?
---
This project is created using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). The website will be similar to a blog in the aspect that it will feature posts and articles.  Each article will allow for comments through Facebook, though I may expand upon the avilable options for commenting.  I will be allowing writers to feature their work on the site.  

### What can a post contain?
---
A post contains a title, a body of text, and an image.  Once again, I may expand upon these options.  The subject of which the post will be written will be entirely up to the writer, however I will maintain the right to remove anything that I feel is overly offensive, or illegal.

### What is Ogonek?
---
THE Ogonek is a small tail added to vowels in the Latin alphabet.  Ogonek is the name of a small orginization that produces for your enjoyment.

### How can I get involved?
---
The development team will remain very small in the beginning so our interest in finding development members, at the moment, is very small.  We are currently looking for people who will be interested in writers who wish to produce content for this website.

If you are interested in getting involved in this project, please email me at: zackazt@gmail.com
